Some days I wonder if I'm cut out for this, but then I remember why I started. Still, the loneliness hits different when you're responsible for everything.`,

After months of trying different approaches, I've created this hybrid bullet journal + digital system. The key was accepting that my brain needs both structure AND flexibility.

Morning pages for brain dump â†’ digital calendar for time blocks â†’ physical notebook for daily tasks. It sounds complicated but it actually reduces my mental load.

The game changer was realizing I don't need to be "normal" - I need to work WITH my ADHD brain, not against it. Still have rough days, but I'm not fighting myself anymore.`,

I'm not mourning the relationship - that was over long before the papers were signed. I'm mourning the life I thought I'd have, the future I'd planned. Starting over at 34 feels simultaneously terrifying and liberating.

Taking it one day at a time. Some days are good, some aren't. Today was okay.`,

It's been 8 months since I moved here for work, and honestly, making adult friends is HARD. Dating apps for friendship feel weird, meetups were hit or miss, and work colleagues are nice but we don't click outside the office.

But last week at the dog park (yes, I got a dog partly for this reason ðŸ˜…), I met Sarah. We ended up talking for an hour about everything and nothing. She invited me to her book club, and it felt so natural.

For anyone else struggling with this - it really does take time. I was starting to think something was wrong with me, but sometimes you just need to find your people.`,

Financial anxiety is real - even though I'm making decent money, the irregularity messes with my head. I miss the security of a steady paycheck, but I don't miss the soul-crushing meetings about meetings.

This transition is teaching me so much about myself. I'm more resilient than I thought, but also more social than I realized. Working on finding that balance.`,

I've been so focused on my deficits that I forgot about my strengths. Yes, I struggle with executive function, but I also hyperfocus on things I love and come up with solutions others don't see.

Still need strategies and support, but now I'm working WITH my brain instead of against it. Game changer.`,
